# capstone_project
Built an end-to-end CMS pipeline: cleaned IP/OP claims + beneficiary (2008â€“2010), engineered demographics/coverage/chronic flags, consolidated by DESYNPUF_ID, modeled total spend (regression) and 3-band risk (XGBoost/RF), and outlined a Streamlit app with multi-condition inputs.
